    There are two main ways to write an annotation for SQL (or code in general):
    
    <ol>
      <li>Attempt a direct 'translation' from code to English - 'What is the [COLUMN1] where [COLUMN2] is [CONSTANT]', for instance: 'What is the population of the country called Romania?'</li>
      <li>Attempt to describe the answer you are really looking for, assuming you write from the perspective of someone who doesn't know SQL: 'How many people live in Romania?'</li>
    </ol>
   
    <ul>
      <li> Whenever possible, try to write from the perspective of someone who isn't particularly familiar with SQL or the database schema. </li>
      <li> The query descriptions should be unambigous: A programmer should be able to directly write the corresponding SQL, without requiring additional information. </li>
      <li> Try to use synonyms and paraphrasing ("How many inhabitants/people/ .. ", "Count the number of .."). The more varied the descriptions, the more useful they are to us. </li>
      <li> If you are not sure, skip the current sample with the "Skip" button. </li>
    </ul>
